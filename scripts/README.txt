# the scripts directory contains scripts that take a dataframe of alleles with allele counts (from ../data)
# and runs one of the scoring metrics

# these may be .sh scripts (for running on the sanger farm)
# or they may be R scripts for more simple scoring functions (e.g. phastcons scores)

# in the case that data has been generated by someone else, a .sh stub will be written describing
# when the data was generated, who generated it, and who to get in contact with for more information.
