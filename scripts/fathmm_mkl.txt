# FATHMM-MKL

# the genome-wide annotation tabix file was downloaded from: https://github.com/HAShihab/fathmm-MKL
# and the instructions for building the index were easily completed

# the database is stored at: /lustre/scratch113/projects/ddd/users/ps14/fathmm

# the library (found in https://github.com/HAShihab/fathmm-MKL) is used to query the tabix for input alleles

# run scoring on all of the alleles at once:

cd ~/software/fathmm-MKL
